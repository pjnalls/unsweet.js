<h1 align="center">Unsweet.js Tutorial: Sugar Journal App</h1>

## Purpose
I want to walkthrough solving a realistic problem from inception to resolution with a solution that is resourceful yet both elegant and efficient. That's the challenge of Unsweet.js.

"Going *sugarless*" (or "developing apps with a *plain* set of tools") may seem negative like it sounds, but I've found for myself that there are great benefits to doing so. It makes me appreciate front-end and back-end web frameworks and libraries much more as a developer. More importanly, it shows me how *and why* any code that I write works as an *engineer* — not *just* showing me it working.

Sure, we could just use a command-line interface to generate a boilerplate, kitchen-sink, cross-platform app that runs anywhere, copy this piece of code, copy that piece of code, and just say it's done; however, I think it's important to fully acquire deep understanding of how are code works — from language syntax to entire stacks.
