## Purpose of "Going Sugarless"
I felt the need to walkthrough solving a realistic problem from inception to resolution with a solution that is technically resourceful yet both elegant and efficient. This is what "sugarless-yet-decadent", Unsweet.js development means to me.

"Going *sugarless*" (or "developing apps with a *plain* set of tools") may sounds like technological deprevation, but I've discovered for myself that there are great benefits to doing so. It makes me truely appreciate front-end and back-end web frameworks and libraries much more as a developer. More importanly, it shows me how *and why* any code that I write works as an *engineer*. That's more important in the long term than *just* getting it to work.

In other words, I think we all can become far better developers by going sugarless even if we never use an Unsweet.js approach for any real-world, web development.

Sure, we could just use a command-line interface to generate a boilerplate, kitchen-sink, cross-platform app that runs anywhere, copy this piece of code, copy that piece of code, and say it's done; however, I think it's important to fully acquire deep understanding of how are code works ‚Äî from language syntax to entire stacks.
