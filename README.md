## Purpose of "Going Sugarless"
I felt the need to walkthrough solving a realistic web development problem from inception to resolution with a solution that takes the challange of using plain, core JavaScript with no added dependencies other than Node.js and builds an app with as much JavaScript as possible — from markup to I/O. 

You'll notice in my example that I'm using JavaScript to bootstrap the user interface. This is to simply show what JavaScript alone can accomplish. I essentially want to explore the meaning of "sugarless-yet-decadent" Unsweet.js development and what it means to me.

"Going *sugarless*" (or "developing apps with a *plain* set of tools") may sound undesirable, but I think there are great benefits for doing so. I speak for myself by saying it makes me truely appreciate front-end and back-end web frameworks and libraries much more as a developer. More importantly, it shows me not just the how but *why* certain code that I write works as an *engineer*.
